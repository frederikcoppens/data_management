## Description of data

*Describe the data types the research will collect, generate and/or reuse*

This is specific for each research project. Be aware that you might generate more data then you initially think: sequencing, proteomics, phenotyping, microscopy, qPCR, spreadsheets with measurements, ...

You can find a draft text with details for each datatype [here](datatypes/datatypes.md), this is a work in progress !

## Data Storage

*Are the following provisions in place in order to preserve the data during and at least 5 years after the end of the research?*

### Designation of responsible person

Here you can fill in the name of the IT manager. This off course entails that you notify the IT manager of your project proposal in due time and comply to the guidelines that PSB puts forward. These guidelines will be developed, as a starting point:

All data needs to be stored on shared drives (group drive, dedicated project share, ...). Storing data on hard disks of personal computers (your own or from the institute), external hard drives, USB flash drives, ... is not acceptable.

### Storage capacity/repository during/after research

During the research all data will be stored in the data center at the VIB-UGent Center for Plant Systems Biology. Sufficient storage capacity will be ensured for the project.
The data integrity is ensured through internal replication of the storage array and tape backup.

Data will be stored for at least five years after completion of the research project.
Upon publication, relevant data will be made available either in appropriate repositories or e.g. using service such as zenodo.org, dryad, etc.   


### Data preservation

*Is there a reason you wish to deviate from the principle of preservation of data and of the minimum preservation term of 5 years?*

Data will be stored for at least five years after completion of the research project.


### Ethics

*If issues concerning research data are indicated in the ethics questionnaire of this application form, will those data require specific security measures; if yes, can they be put in place?*

As the project does not involve research on embryo's, foetus, humans, or animals, no ethical issues are involved.


### Other

*Are there other issues related to the data management you think relevant to mention?*

Feedback to FWO can be provided here.
