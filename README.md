## Data Management Plan (DMP)

Data management is an integral part of sound scientific research.  It covers

* the description of data and metadata,
* their storage and long-term preservation,
* the designation of responsible persons,
* the handling of highly sensitive data,
* and the open access to and sharing of research data.

## Funders

### FWO

The FWO has made data management a key element of its policy for all support channels provided by the FWO. The FWO expects researchers to pay due attention to this dimension **before, during and for at least five years after** their research.
