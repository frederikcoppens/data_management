## Sequencing based data

### RNA-seq short version

 Raw RNA sequencing data will be stored as compressed fastq files. Processed data are tab-delimited text files containing read counts per gene.
  Upon publication, data will be submitted to ArrayExpress.
Details of the analysis methodology will be provided.  Metadata will be captured conform the standards of this repository. The minimum set of data and meta-data for a given study/experiment is defined in MINSEQE ( http://fged.org/projects/minseqe/) for NGS.

Section 2 Question 2: Describe the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its (estimated) volume. If re-use indicate source

#### Origin

* Reuse : likely public repositories GEO, ArrayExpress
* Generation of data

#### Data type, format

* Raw digital data, compressed FastQ data, ~1-5GB per dataset
example:
Digital data:

    RNAseq data; Next generation sequencing raw data, compressed fastq format
    16 genotypes, 1 tissue from maize; per sample 20M 75bp PE illumina reads; 3 replicates; totalling 96Gb;

#### Volume

Project dependent

SIZE estimates 
* 20M, 75bp, SE illumina reads: 1Gb / sample
* 20M, 75bp, PE illumina reads: 2Gb / sample

* 20M, 100bp, PE illumina reads: 3Gb / sample
