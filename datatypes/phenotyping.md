# Phenotyping

Plant phenotyping data will be stored and made available upon publication in PIPPA (https://pippa.psb.ugent.be), maintained by the VIB-UGent Center for Plant Systems Biology. PIPPA uses and is compliant with MIAPPE (https://github.com/MIAPPE/MIAPPE), The Minimal Information About Plant Phenotyping Experiment.

## Measurements

## RGB Images
Phenovision (& WIWAM) : 4Mb / image

For Phenovision typically 7 RGB images per pot/timepoint (3 sideway by 2 cameras (60 degree angles), en 1 from top).

## Thermal images
Infrared (LWIR): 1Mb /  image

## Hyperspectral images
(grouped in dirs with 'capture' subdirectory containing .raw en .hdr files, 3/witreference + 3/zwartreference & image itself)

    SWIR: 99mb
    VNIR: 85mb
totalling to +- 185~200 Mb/ hyperspectral image
