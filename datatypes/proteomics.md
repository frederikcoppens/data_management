## Tandem Affinity Purification

## Protein binding Microarray

UniProbe

## Post-translational Modifications

We have developed an online database, Plant PTM Viewer (bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/ptm_viewer/), hosted at VIB-UGent, where it is possible to consult all our newly identified phosphosites.

## Interactions

All published protein interaction data will be deposited to the IntAct Molecular Interaction Database.

## Protein complex modelling
