## Proteomics

Raw MS spectra data will be stored. Upon publication, proteomics data will be submitted to PRIDE. Metadata will be captured conform the MIAPE standards (http://www.psidev.info/miape) of this repository.

## Affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) 

_while waiting for (more) accurate volume estimates we will use 500Mb per sample for Arabidopsis
(somewhat reflects what is alreada in PRIDE, eg this entry https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD002606/files)
data file sizes seems to be in reference to the organism?_

According to Dominique (TAP serivce) one AP-MS run produces approx. 1Gb per run (for a 1h LC-MS/MS). For a 3h run it's likley more towards 1.2-1.5Gb per run

## Tandem Affinity Purification

## Protein binding Microarray

UniProbe

## Post-translational Modifications

We have developed an online database, Plant PTM Viewer (bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/ptm_viewer/), hosted at VIB-UGent, where it is possible to consult all our newly identified phosphosites.

## Interactions

All published protein interaction data will be deposited to the IntAct Molecular Interaction Database.

## Protein complex modelling
