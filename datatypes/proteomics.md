## Proteomics

Raw MS spectra data will be stored. Upon publication, data will be submitted to PRIDE. Metadata will be captured conform the standards of this repository.

## Protein binding Microarray

UniProbe

## Post-translational Modifications

We have developed an online database, Plant PTM Viewer (bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/ptm_viewer/), hosted at VIB-UGent, where it is possible to consult all our newly identified phosphosites.

## Interactions

All published protein interaction data will be deposited to the IntAct Molecular Interaction Database.
