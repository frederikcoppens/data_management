## Sequencing based data




### RNA-seq short version

 Raw RNA sequencing data will be stored as compressed fastq files. Processed data are tab-delimited text files containing read counts per gene.
  Upon publication, data will be submitted to ArrayExpress.
Details of the analysis methodology will be provided.  Metadata will be captured conform the standards of this repository

### RNA-seq full version

Section 2 Question 2: Describe the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its (estimated) volume. If re-use indicate source

#### Origin

* Reuse : likely public repositories GEO, ArrayExpress
* Generation of data

#### Data type, format

* Raw digital data, compressed FastQ data, ~1-5GB per dataset



#### Volume

Project dependent

Section 4
