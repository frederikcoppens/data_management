## Sequencing based data

### RNA-seq

 Raw RNA sequencing data will be stored as compressed fastq files. Processed data are tab-delimited text files containing read counts per gene.
  Upon publication, data will be submitted to ArrayExpress.
Details of the analysis methodology will be provided.  Metadata will be captured conform the standards of this repository.

#### Origin

* Reuse : likely public repositories GEO, ArrayExpress
