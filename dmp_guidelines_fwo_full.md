## Description of data

### Will you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?

*If you intend to work with existing or third-party data, consider what (if any) costs are involved, and to what extent you are allowed to reuse and share these data. Regulatory or contractual restrictions (e.g. confidentiality agreements) might apply.*

* yes
* no

### Describe the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its (estimated) volume.

If you reuse existing data, specify the source of these data.
For reuse or generation of data distinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the technical format).

#### Data types

* What types of data will you create?
* Which types of data will have long-term value?

Generally speaking, research data can be viewed as the information that is collected or created during research and subsequently analysed with the aim of generating scientific findings and claims. There are different types of research data, depending on e.g.:

* digital data type (textual, numerical, multimedia)
* data object (text documents, spreadsheets, videotapes, transcripts, questionnaires, lab notebooks)
* mode of data collection (experimental, observational, simulation, derived/compiled data)
* data lifecycle stage (raw, processed, published data).



Outline the types of data that are expected to be produced from the project e.g. quantitative, qualitative, survey data, experimental measurements, models, images, audiovisual data, samples etc.


#### Data format

* What format will your data be in?
* Why have you chosen to use particular formats?
* Do the chosen formats and software enable sharing and long-term validity of data? Choosing non-proprietary or open/standard, and lossless file formats helps ensure future accessibility and usability of your digital data.

#### Data volume

* Do you have sufficient storage?
* Do you need to include costs for additional managed storage?
* Will the scale of the data pose challenges when sharing or transferring data between sites?

Consider the implications of data volumes in terms of storage, backup and access. Estimate the volume of data in MB/GB/TB and how this will grow to make sure any additional storage and technical support required can be provided.

## Ethical and legal issues

Researchers have to comply with ethical standards governing (confidentiality in) research, as well as legal requirements regarding personal data (i.e. information relating to (in)directly identified or identifiable living individuals and therefore requiring special protection to avoid disclosure). At Ghent University, the processing of personal data is governed by Belgian and European privacy protection legislation. Personal data can only be processed for well-defined and justified purposes, which in this case are related to the research goals in question. Researchers are not allowed to collect or process more personal information than necessary for reaching their research goals. Other restrictions exist, especially for medical and other sensitive personal data.

### Will you use personal data?

*If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use AND add the reference to your file in your host institution's privacy register.*

In general, I expect that data used or generated at PSB will not entail personal data.

### Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data ?

* (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use). If so, add the reference to the formal approval by the relevant ethical review committee(s).*

In general, I expect that data used or generated at PSB will not entail ethical issues.


### Does your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created?

*If so, for what data, and which restrictions will be asserted?*

It cannot be excluded that the proposed work will result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorization. Our research organization has a policy to actively monitor research data for such potential. If there is substantial potential, the invention will be thoroughly assessed, and in a number of cases the invention will be IP protected (mostly patent protection or copyright protection). As such the IP protection does not withhold the research data from being made public. In the case a decision is taken to file a patent application it will only mean that a patent application will be filed prior to the data being published in a scientific publication.

### Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?

Research data may be protected by intellectual property rights (e.g. copyright/authors’ rights (“auteursrechten”), database rights, registered industrial rights such as patents), and this can have important implications for data creation, sharing or reuse.

Clarify what (if any) rights will apply to your research data (both those generated by yourself and any third-party data you will use) and who will own these rights, so that you understand early on what you can and cannot do with the data. Keep in mind that there may be joint intellectual property rights, and that rights ownership may be the subject of an agreement (e.g. with Ghent University as your employer, with a funder or a research partner…).

## Documentation and Metadata

### What documentation will be provided to enable understanding and reuse of the data collected/generated in this project?

Good documentation provides the descriptive and contextual information necessary to properly find, interpret and use data in the future.

Identify early on what types of documentation you will need to provide and the efforts involved, taking into account your preservation and sharing plans for the data. You will typically need to document

* at the research project/study level: e.g. research design, context of data collection, data collection methods, quality control procedures, processing and analysis procedures, access conditions…
* at the data level: e.g. variable labels and descriptions, annotated codes used to process raw data

Documentation can be captured in various ways: in a research paper, project report, lab notebook, codebook, separate ‘readme’ file, database, annotated computer script and/or the data files themselves etc. Start documenting at the beginning of the research process; waiting until the very end will make it a much more difficult task.

### Will a metadata standard be used?

*If so, describe in detail which standard will be used. If not, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse.*

Metadata (= ‘data about data’) are a structured subset of data documentation (including elements such as Creator, Title, Date, Subject, Language, Format...) used for example by repositories to catalogue data and thus aid their discovery and reuse. Also, when your research involves analysing large amounts of data, using digital structured metadata will make it easier for you to search them. There are international standards for metadata, such as DublinCore and the DataCite Metadata Schema. Some disciplines or research communities have their own metadata standards.

## Data storage & backup during the FWO project

### Where will the data be stored?

VIB-UGent Center for Plant Systems Biology

### How will the data be backed up?

Access is controlled through standard IT practices and data integrity is ensured through internal replication of the storage array and tape backup.


### Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project?

*If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.*

Sufficient storage capacity will be ensured for the project.

### What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the project? How will these costs be covered?

Guidelines ?

### Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?

Access is controlled through standard IT practices.

## Data preservation after the end of the FWO project

*FWO expects that data generated during the project are retained for a period of minimum 5 years after the end of the project, in so far as legal and contractual agreements allow.*

### Which data will be retained for the expected 5-year period after the end of the project?

*In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues...).*

Data will be stored for at least five years after completion of the research project.


### Where will these data be archived (= stored for the long term)?

VIB-UGent Center for Plant Systems Biology

### What are the expected costs for data preservation during these 5 years? How will the costs be covered?

Guidelines ?


## Data sharing and reuse

### Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?

IP ?

### Which data will be made available after the end of the project?

Project dependent

### Where/how will the data be made available for reuse?

* In an Open Access repository
* In a restricted access repository
* Upon request by mail
* Other (specify)
